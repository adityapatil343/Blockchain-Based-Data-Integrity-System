# 🔐 Blockchain-Based Data Integrity System 
## ✅ Use Project Report.docx for better understanding. (Download and open it using any PDF or Word file viewer.) ✅

---

## 📌 Features:

1. [Optional] Encrypt File – Using AES encryption for data privacy.
2. Upload to IPFS – Via Pinata WebApp for decentralized storage.
3. Get CID – A unique content identifier generated by IPFS.
4. Store CID on Blockchain – For immutability and public verification (e.g., Polygon).
5. Retrieve File using CID – Anyone with the CID can access the exact file from IPFS.
6. Verify – Confirm data authenticity using blockchain explorers like PolygonScan or Etherscan.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `Python` for file encryption
- `cryptography` library for AES encryption
- `IPFS` for decentralized file storage
- `Pinata` WebApp for uploading files to IPFS
- `Solidity` for writing smart contracts
- `Remix IDE` for smart contract deployment and interaction (easy for beginners)
- `Polygon Blockchain` for CID registration
- `PolygonScan` (blockchain explorer) for on-chain CID verification

# 🧭 Project Workflow

## ✅ Step 1: (Optional) Encrypt File using AES

Use Python's `cryptography` library to encrypt your file before uploading.

    python3 AES.py

Choose option 1 or 2
Select a file from your system
Enter a 5-character key (like a1b2C, 12345, aaaaa, or yy9zz)
It will encrypt or decrypt accordingly 🎉

⚠️ Save your AES key securely. You’ll need it to decrypt the file later.

---

## 📤 Step 2: Upload Encrypted File to IPFS using Pinata WebApp

1. Go to [https://app.pinata.cloud](https://app.pinata.cloud)
2. Sign up / log in
3. Navigate to **"Upload" > "File"**
4. Choose your encrypted file (`.enc`) or original file
5. Upload it

After upload, you'll get an **IPFS CID** like: <QmTzQ1dU8m3vC5RQjV5zsdVxzyRzv2Yw9B9oP2C1WnZqhB>

---

## ⛓️ Step 3: Store CID on Blockchain using Smart Contract (via Remix IDE)

### 🔧 Deploying Smart Contract with Remix IDE

1. Visit [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Create a new file (e.g., `StoreCID.sol`) and paste the following Solidity code:

and paste .sol code(contract create) (edit it using your data)

### ⚙️ Remix IDE Steps (Smart Contract Deployment)

1. Go to the **Solidity Compiler** tab:
   - Select version `0.8.x`
   - Click **Compile StoreCID.sol**

2. Go to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab:
   - Set environment to **Injected Web3** *(MetaMask must be installed)*
   - Select the appropriate network:
     - ✅ **Polygon Mainnet** → [https://polygonscan.com](https://polygonscan.com)
     - 🧪 **Mumbai Testnet** → [https://mumbai.polygonscan.com](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com)
   - Click **Deploy**

3. After deployment:
   - Expand the deployed contract panel
   - Use `storeCID()` `storename()` to **submit your IPFS CID & FILE NAME**
   - Use `storedCID()` `storedname()` to **read the stored value**

4. Go to the respective blockchain explorer:
   - i) Search your **contract address** and checkout Events section
   - ii) remix ide: View the stored CID under **Read Contract > storedCID**

🛡️ **Your CID is now permanently and publicly stored on the blockchain!**

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Verify Data Integrity

Use the CID to retrieve the file from any IPFS gateway: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/YourCID


- Match the file content or compare hashes to verify integrity  
- If you stored the CID on blockchain:
  - Go to [PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com) or [Mumbai Explorer](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com)
  - Search your **smart contract address** and check Events section
  - if you wanna verify on remix ide: Call the `storedCID` function to verify the stored CID

---

## Step 5: (Optional) Decrypt Encrypted File
Once the CID is verified and you've downloaded the encrypted file from IPFS, use the following command to decrypt:

    python3 AES.py
    
🔑 Make sure to use the same AES key used during encryption.

## 🔐 Data Security Flow

[Encrypt File] → [Upload to IPFS via Pinata] → [Get CID] → [Store CID on Blockchain] → [Verify CID anytime] → [Retrieve File using CID anytime]
